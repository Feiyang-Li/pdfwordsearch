      "Our AI-powered mental therapy bot offers several essential services for external systems \n",
      "to better analyze and assess the mental well-being of individuals. One of the core services \n",
      "provided is the Emotional Support API. This API allows third-party applications, such as health \n",

      "act as a second choice for users who can not get an appointment with a therapist or are in \n",
      "desperate need to resolve their anxiousness. From a technical point of view, our API can be \n",
      "accessible through HTTPS, and to utilize this service, external systems need to send a POST \n",
      "request to our secure endpoint at   https://api.mentaltherapybot.com/v1/emotional-support ,  \n",
      "including an API key in the header for us to correctly authenticate them. The request body must \n",

      "conversation-id, prompt from the user, and a timestamp of when the user has input the prompt. \n",
      "After receiving the data, our system will check if all the data follows the correct format. For \n",
      "example, the parameters user-id must be valid containing only letters and numbers, and is within \n",
      "the character limit. Also, we will check if the user prompt is within the character limit, and if the \n",

      "●​ Platform:\n",
      "○​ Cloud Provider: AWS (Amazon Web Services) - EC2 Instances (t3.medium) for\n",
      "web and app servers. It provides a balanced mix of compute, memory, and\n",
      "network resources at a reasonable cost.\n",

      "○​ VPN: VPN Gateway for secure internal communication between services.\n",
      "●​ Data:\n",
      "○​ MySQL Database: For structured data storage such as user information, session\n",

      "Services Offered to External Systems:\n",
      "Our AI-powered mental therapy bot offers several essential services for external systems\n",
      "to better analyze and assess the mental well-being of individuals. One of the core services\n",
      "provided is the Emotional Support API. This API allows third-party applications, such as health\n",
      "apps and websites, employee well-being platforms in companies, and mediation and relaxation\n",
      "service providers to directly use this API to enable AI-driven therapeutic conversations that\n",
      "improve their services' quality and performance. This API can analyze the user's sentiment and\n",
      "provide real-time analysis and interactions. When used in the external systems mentioned, it can\n",
      "act as a second choice for users who can not get an appointment with a therapist or are in\n",
      "desperate need to resolve their anxiousness. From a technical point of view, our API can be\n",
      "accessible through HTTPS, and to utilize this service, external systems need to send a POST\n",
      "request to our secure endpoint at https://api.mentaltherapybot.com/v1/emotional-support,\n",
      "including an API key in the header for us to correctly authenticate them. The request body must\n",
      "contain the exact data in JSON format following our requirements, which includes a user-id,\n",
      "conversation-id, prompt from the user, and a timestamp of when the user has input the prompt.\n",
      "After receiving the data, our system will check if all the data follows the correct format. For\n",
      "example, the parameters user-id must be valid containing only letters and numbers, and is within\n",
      "the character limit. Also, we will check if the user prompt is within the character limit, and if the\n",
      "timestamp is correctly formatted as required. In cases of detecting these errors mentioned, the\n",
      "API will communicate clearly through HTTPS error codes such as “500” and “400”, followed by\n",
      "the corresponding output explaining what the error is in text format.\n",
      "Furthermore, Our system also provides an analysis and dashboard of each user’s mental\n",
      "health situation. With certain security and privacy measures in place, an authorized therapist or\n",
      "doctor can gain direct access to the patient’s data stored in our database, and be able to view\n",
      "detailed analysis through interactive dashboards provided so that they can make more informed\n",
      "diagnoses and provide better decisions to resolve the patient’s problems. To gain access to this\n",
      "service, we offer connection through an HTTPS link https://dashboard.mentaltherapybot.com.\n",
      "For each authorized therapist or doctor, they will have their unique login credentials\n",
      "created and approved by our team, and each time they want to use this service, they must use this\n",
      "login information and go through a 2-factor authentication for security purposes. In addition, our\n",
      "security measures include SSL encryption, which encrypts the data transmitted between the\n",
      "user's browser and the server, input validation, and secure credential storage to provide top-level\n",
      "security to our customer’s information. To handle errors such as invalid login information or\n",
      "session timeout, the system will output a corresponding user-friendly message to the interface to\n",

      "b.​ Assume 1 tester for 2 months\n",
      "c.​ $9,600\n",
      "Therefore estimated one-time cost, incurred within 4 months of: $163,200 for development of\n",
      "the software. However, after the development is complete we still need at least 1 developer to\n",
      "maintain the application therefore at minimum require a ~$12,000/months\n",
      "The security and compliance cost:\n",
      "1.​ SSL Certificate (for HTTPS API & Dashboard)\n",

      "3.​ Monthly cost of: 2 people * 30 days * 8 hours * $40/hour = $19, 200\n",
      "So the cost of the support therapist would be $19,200/ month\n",
      "Based on the cost analysis we would have an on-going cost $35,051/month and a one-time cost\n",
      "of $542,800. The data mainly obtained from AWS main website, and the average Ontario wage\n",
      "for different occupations. In addition, this cost is estimated with a minimalist assumption, the\n",
